# Savant: Intelligent Optimization Problem Solver

Savant is an intelligent Python library that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and DSPy to parse, solve, and visualize optimization problems. It provides both a command-line interface and a web interface for users to input problem descriptions in natural language and automatically generates solutions using Answer Set Programming (ASP).

## 🌟 Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes GPT-4 and DSPy for robust optimization problem parsing
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates Clorm predicates and ASP programs
- **Problem Validation**: Validates if a problem can be solved with ASP before attempting to solve it
- **Interactive Gap Filling**: Asks for additional information when problem descriptions are incomplete
- **Problem Solving**: Implements optimization problem solving using Clingo
- **Dual Interface**: Command-line interface for direct usage and web interface for interactive solving
- **Modern Python Package**: Installable via pip with proper CLI integration

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install Savant
pip install savant

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Solve a problem directly from the command line
savant -p "Minimize x+y subject to x>=0, y>=0, x+y<=10"

# Or run the web interface
savant --web --port 5000
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An OpenAI API key

## 📦 Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install savant
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/terraprompt/savant.git
cd savant
pip install .
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Savant can be configured using environment variables:

```bash
# Required: Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Configure the LLM model (default: gpt-4o)
export SAVANT_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo

# Optional: Set a custom Flask secret key
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_flask_secret_key_here
```

## 🖥️ Usage

### Command Line Interface

Solve optimization problems directly from the command line:

```bash
# Solve a problem directly
savant -p "We have a task scheduling problem. Each task has a name, duration, and priority. We need to schedule tasks within a maximum time of 10 units. Tasks cannot overlap. We want to maximize the total priority of scheduled tasks. Available tasks are: Task1: duration 3, priority 5; Task2: duration 2, priority 3; Task3: duration 4, priority 7; Task4: duration 1, priority 2."

# Run the web interface on a custom port
savant --web --port 8080
```

### Interactive Problem Solving

When a problem description is incomplete, Savant will ask for additional information:

```bash
savant -p "Solve a scheduling problem"
# Savant will ask: "What are the tasks and their properties?"
# You can then provide: "Task1: duration 3, priority 5; Task2: duration 2, priority 3"
```

### Web Interface

Run the web interface to solve problems interactively:

```bash
# Run on default port 5000
savant --web

# Run on a custom port
savant --web --port 8080
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` (or your custom port) to access the web interface. The web interface also supports interactive gap filling - if your problem description is incomplete, Savant will ask for additional information directly in the web interface.

### Python API

Use Savant directly in your Python code:

```python
from savant.solver import solve_optimization_problem

problem_description = """
We have a task scheduling problem. Each task has a name, duration, and priority.
We need to schedule tasks within a maximum time of 10 units.
Tasks cannot overlap.
We want to maximize the total priority of scheduled tasks.

Available tasks are:
Task1: duration 3, priority 5
Task2: duration 2, priority 3
Task3: duration 4, priority 7
Task4: duration 1, priority 2
"""

result = solve_optimization_problem(problem_description)

if result.needs_more_info:
    print("Please provide more information:")
    for question in result.questions:
        print(f"- {question}")
elif result.error:
    print(f"Error: {result.error}")
else:
    print(f"Solution: {result.solution}")
```

## 💡 Example Use Cases

### 1. Task Scheduling Problem

```bash
savant -p "Schedule tasks to maximize priority. TaskA (duration 3, priority 5), TaskB (duration 2, priority 4), TaskC (duration 4, priority 7). Time limit is 8 units. Tasks cannot overlap."
```

### 2. Resource Allocation

```bash
savant -p "Allocate 3 projects to 2 teams. Project1 (value 100, requires 2 team members), Project2 (value 150, requires 3 team members), Project3 (value 80, requires 1 team member). Total team members available: 4. Maximize total value."
```

### 3. Knapsack Problem

```bash
savant -p "Knapsack with capacity 10. Item1 (weight 5, value 10), Item2 (weight 4, value 7), Item3 (weight 6, value 12), Item4 (weight 2, value 3). Maximize value without exceeding capacity."
```

### 4. Graph Coloring

```bash
savant -p "Color a graph with 4 nodes and edges: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,4). Use minimum number of colors such that adjacent nodes have different colors."
```

### 5. Sudoku Solver

```bash
savant -p "Solve a 4x4 Sudoku puzzle. Given: position (1,1) = 1, position (1,3) = 2, position (2,2) = 3, position (3,1) = 4. Find values for all positions respecting Sudoku rules."
```
