# Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Savant project from a Flask web application with user authentication to a PyPI library with both CLI and web interfaces, and then enhanced with DSPy for better LLM prompting, and finally with interactive gap filling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Project Structure
- Removed all authentication-related code (User, Problem models, login/register routes)
- Restructured as a proper Python package with CLI entry point
- Updated to use modern OpenAI Python library (v1.x)
- Improved error handling and security (replaced `eval` with `json.loads`)
- Ensured all configuration uses environment variables (no hardcoded values)

### 2. Core Functionality
- Preserved the core optimization problem solving capabilities
- Integrated DSPy for better LLM prompting and program generation
- Added problem validation to reject requests that don't make sense for ASP
- Added interactive gap filling to ask for more information when problem descriptions are incomplete
- Maintained Clorm and ASP integration

### 3. Interfaces
- Created a CLI interface using Click that can:
  - Solve problems directly from command line
  - Run a web interface
  - Interactively ask for more information when needed
- Simplified the web interface to remove user management
- Enhanced web interface with interactive gap filling
- Kept HTMX for dynamic interactions in the web UI

### 4. Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests
- Mocked external API calls for reliable testing
- Added test coverage for both solver and CLI components
- Added tests for interactive functionality

### 5. Documentation
- Updated README with new usage instructions and use cases
- Added proper package metadata
- Documented both CLI and Python API usage
- Documented interactive gap filling functionality

## New Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Solve a problem directly
savant -p "Minimize x+y subject to x>=0, y>=0, x+y<=10"

# Run the web interface
savant --web --port 5000
```

### Python API
```python
from savant.solver import solve_optimization_problem

result = solve_optimization_problem("problem description")

if result.needs_more_info:
    print("Please provide more information:")
    for question in result.questions:
        print(f"- {question}")
elif result.error:
    print(f"Error: {result.error}")
else:
    print(f"Solution: {result.solution}")
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Security**: Replaced `eval` with `json.loads` for safer parsing
2. **Modularity**: Better separation of concerns between CLI, web, and solver components
3. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure with proper package organization
4. **Usability**: Dual interface (CLI and web) for different user preferences
5. **Testability**: Comprehensive test suite with mocked external dependencies
6. **Packaging**: Proper PyPI package structure with entry points
7. **Intelligence**: DSPy-based prompting for more reliable LLM outputs
8. **Validation**: Problem validation to reject unsolvable requests
9. **Interactivity**: Interactive gap filling to ask for missing information

## DSPy Integration

The new DSPy integration provides several benefits:

1. **Better Prompting**: Structured prompts for more consistent LLM outputs
2. **Validation**: Automatic validation of whether a problem can be solved with ASP
3. **Gap Identification**: Automatic detection of missing information in problem descriptions
4. **Modularity**: Separate modules for analysis, generation, validation, and gap identification
5. **Reliability**: More robust handling of edge cases and malformed inputs

## Interactive Gap Filling

The interactive gap filling feature provides several benefits:

1. **User Guidance**: Asks specific questions when problem descriptions are incomplete
2. **Problem Refinement**: Refines problem descriptions with additional user information
3. **Better Solutions**: Produces more accurate solutions with complete information
4. **User Experience**: More intuitive interaction for users who may not know all details upfront

## Use Cases

The updated Savant can handle various optimization problems:

1. Task scheduling
2. Resource allocation
3. Knapsack problems
4. Graph coloring
5. Sudoku puzzles
6. And many more optimization challenges

The interactive gap filling makes Savant more user-friendly by guiding users through the problem specification process, especially when they don't have all the details upfront.
